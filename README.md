# PyLCOM
This module calculates the _Lack of Cohesion in Methods_ (LCOM) value for Python files. 
This value is an objective measure of the [cohesiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))
of a particular class.

Lower values are better, with 0 being the lowest. Higher values indicate that classes
should be refactored into more cohesive units.
